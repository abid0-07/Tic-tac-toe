# Tic-tac-toe
## A small Tic Tac Toe project using JavaScript

In this project, I used **HTML** to create a basic structure of the game page. Then styling with **CSS** properties. In the HTML section:
every section is divided by using a sperate HTML tag to access and modify that content later with the JS. There are classes for styling with the CSS and id's 
access those tags in the JS. 

CSS styling is divided into four parts. 
---
1) Style.css file: Basic styling of the page is done in this page.
2) Overlays.css file: Name input field overlay styling is handled in this section.
3) Configuration.css file: Player name box styling done in this part.
4) game.css file: Main game board styling done in this part.

JavaScript files
---
1) app.js file: All the variables and DOM access handled in this section.
2) congifg.js file: Player information save in this section.
3) game.js file: All the game login and start game is in this section.
